# Face Spoofing Detection Through Visual Codebooks of Spectral Temporal Cubes

### Abstract

Despite important recent advances, the vulnerability of biometric systems to spoofing attacks is still an open problem. Spoof attacks occur when impostor users present synthetic biometric samples of a valid user to the biometric system seeking to deceive it. Considering the case of face biometrics, a spoofing attack consists in presenting a fake sample (e.g., photograph, digital video or even a 3D mask) to the acquisition sensor with the facial information of a valid user. In this paper, we introduce a low-cost and software-based method for detecting spoofing attempts in face recognition systems. Our hypothesis is that during acquisition there will be inevitable artifacts left behind in the recaptured biometric samples allowing us to create a discriminative signature of the video generated by the biometric sensor. To characterize these artifacts, we extract time-spectral feature descriptors from the video, which can be understood as a low-level feature descriptor that gathers temporal and spectral information across the biometric sample and use the visual codebook concept to find mid-level feature descriptors computed from the low-level ones. Such descriptors are more robust for detecting several kinds of attacks than low-level ones. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting different types of attacks in a variety of scenarios and datasets including photos, videos and 3D masks.


### Requirements to Run this Software

The OpenCV Package 2.4.11 or later is required to use this software.

The other requirements are python packages and are listed in **requirements.txt**.
We provide a script *(install_requirements.sh)*, to install theses python requirements via **pip command**.    

This software runs on Linux Operating systems, and we tested it by using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

#### Instaling dependences

We recommend using the virtualenv tool to create a proper environment to run this software. Follows the command lines to configure a virtual environment to run this software:

1. Installing the virualenv and virtualenvwrapper tools:
>     pip install virtualenv
>     pip install virtualenvwrapper

2. Installing all depedences of our sofwware:
>     mkvirtualenv spectralcubes-env   # -- create a new environment
>     workon spectralcubes-env         # -- active the virtualenv
>     ./install_requirements.sh        # -- run the bash script provided in this repository (https://github.com/allansp84/spectralcubes/blob/master/install_requirements.sh)

Obs.: It is necessary to add the command to source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh to your shell startup file. Please, change the path to virtualenvwrapper.sh depending on where it was installed by pip. You can find more information about virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper in https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/ and https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/, respectively.
